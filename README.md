# 💻 Welcome to Derme's Github Profile!

## 👋 About Me

Hello stranger! My name is Ioannis Deirmentzoglou and I'm an undergraduated Electrical and Computer Engineering student in my final year, about to graduate with an integrated master’s degree from the School of Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve specialized in **machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and digital systems design**, exploring how intelligent systems can process, analyze, and make decisions from data.

💡I’m interested about applying artificial intelligence and computational techniques to solve complex problems across multiple domains—from image processing and hardware acceleration to prediction systems, smart grids, power systems analysis, and automation. I’m particularly drawn to the intersection of machine learning and hardware design, exploring how intelligent algorithms can be embedded, accelerated, and optimized directly at the hardware level for efficient, real-time applications. I’m eager to explore the implementation of deep learning and neural networks on hardware platforms like FPGAs, addressing challenges such as resource optimization, parallelism, low-latency inference, and hardware-software co-design.
